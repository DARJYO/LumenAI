## Usage

To use LumenAI in your project, import the necessary modules and initialize the framework as follows:
```
from lumenai import Lumen

# Initialize LumenAI
lumen = Lumen()

# Load a pre-trained model
model = lumen.load_model('model_name')

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(data)
```

## API Endpoints

LumenAI provides RESTful API endpoints for seamless integration:

- `POST /predict`: Generate insights based on user input.
- `GET /health`: Check the health status of the API.
- `POST /train`: Fine-tune the model with custom datasets.

Refer to the [API Documentation](docs/api.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## Architecture

LumenAI is built on the following stack:

- **Backend**: FastAPI for API handling.
- **Model**: Hugging Face Transformers for NLP.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing user inputs and metadata.
- **Frontend (optional)**: React for building user interfaces.
